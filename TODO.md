	2.TODO:(after few days,not Monday,not Wednesday,not Friday,and Not Weekend.)
		I.Remove the MainActivity,replace it with ViewPager
		II.Add a "favorite button to save the linked answers
	3.WHAT HAPPENED:
		During this development,I realized it's so hard for me to complete the whole project,not even to mention learning android.I'll leave this work unperfectly done,though I don't want to do this,but it seems I have to.
		So no matter what the eventual version will look like,what the rate people will give it,I accept all of them.I knew it's hard,but tried to do.Well , it is just at this very moment that I know I will fail.
